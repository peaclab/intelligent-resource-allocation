## Abstract
In High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, users estimate the resources needed for job submissions based on their best knowledge. However, underestimating the required execution time, number of processors, or memory size can lead to early job terminations. Conversely, overestimating resource requests results in inefficiencies in job backfilling, wasted compute power, unused memory, and poor job scheduling, ultimately reducing overall system efficiency.

As we enter the exascale era, efficient resource utilization is more critical than ever. Existing schedulers lack mechanisms to predict the resource requirements of batch jobs. To address this challenge, we design a data-driven recommendation framework that leverages historical job information to predict three key parameters for batch jobs: execution time, maximum memory size, and maximum number of CPU cores required.

In contrast to existing machine learning (ML) based resource prediction methods, we introduce an online resource suggestion framework that considers both underestimates and overestimates in batch job resource provisioning. Our framework outperforms the baseline method with no grouping mechanism by achieving over 98% success in eliminating underpredictions and reducing the amount of overpredictions.
